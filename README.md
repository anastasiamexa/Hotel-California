# Hotel-California
A DBMS for managing a hotel.

As part of the course "Databases", we built a database for a hotel and a python script to run some queries.

## Queries
- (a) How many reservations correspond to each room category.
- (b) Which room category has the highest turnover based on bookings.
- (c) How many rooms are currently available for booking.
- (d) What facilities are available in specific rooms.
- (e) Which guests have a reservation this month.
- (f) What is the average profit per room type/category for the summer season.
- (g) Who is the most booked customer per room rate bandwidth.
- (h) Which rooms have been rented from date “X” to date.

## Tech
We used pgAdmin 4 and PostgreSQL to create the database and run the queries.

## Documentation
The file [Documantation.pdf](https://github.com/anastasiamexa/Hotel-California/blob/main/Documantation.pdf) contains a detailed description of the methods used to create 
the application (in Greek). The file [db_diagram.pdf](https://github.com/anastasiamexa/Hotel-California/blob/main/db_diagram.pdf) contains the database schema.
